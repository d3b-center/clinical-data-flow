# ✔️ Clinical Data Flow Team Objectives and Key Results

## Objectives (1 Year - end of 2020)

1. Increase interoperability, data access, and flow among internal
   CHOP stakeholders and external stakeholders

    - Replace the Kids First Data Service with a FHIR data service since FHIR
      is the emerging standard for modeling, searching, exchanging, and
      distributing biomedical data.

    - Provide an API and an app for stakeholders that makes it easy to
      browse and download data in their FHIR server

    - Provide an API or app for stakeholders that makes it easy to exchange
      data from one FHIR server to another FHIR server

    - Secure the clinical data service(s) with encryption, authentication, and
      authorization so that only users with necessary permissions to
      access a subset of data may access it

2. Increase participation from domain experts and decrease participation
   from developers in clinical data model development

    - Provide tooling to make local FHIR model validation, testing easier for
      model developers
    - Document and publish the clinical data model in a technology agnostic way
      such that non-technical stakeholders may understand it
    - Automate FHIR model deployment - validate, test, publish documentation,
      load into server

3. Decrease the time to deliver a study's high quality clean clinical data

    - Reduce manual and redundant analyst efforts to do data accounting by
      automating accounting tests and report generation
    - Reduce manual and redundant analyst efforts to do quality assessment
      on data as it moves through the clinical data pipeline    
    - Make quality assessment and control a more collaborative process among
      data curators and data analysts in the quality assessment

4. Improve the completeness and quality of clinical data for researchers

    - Reduce manual and redundant curator effort in ontology harmonization
      by automating harmonization with a smarter/machine learning based process
    - Make it easier for curators to collaborate on ontology harmonization by
      providing

5. Contribute to the open source FHIR community to increase collaboration on
   tool, service, and app development.

   - Open source FHIR model development tool chain and pipeline
   - Open source FHIR data dashboard
   - Open source <etc>
