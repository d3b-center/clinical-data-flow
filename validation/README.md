# Clinical Data Validation

Prototyping for validating relational data based on a set of rules.

## Notebooks

- MVP-Validation-Non-Graph.ipynb (uses DataFrames and does not consider implied connections)
- MVP-Validation-Graph.ipynb (uses a graph and considers implied connections)

Both notebooks output the same validation report
